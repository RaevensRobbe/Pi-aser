# Pi-aser
Hi I am a student Multimedia & Creative Techonlogy at Howest. To show that I understand the basics of what we learned this year I've made a laser piano for my final project.
I Made this project because I am a passionate musician and wanted to integrate my passion for music into my studies.

You have to place your hands under a laser and it will produce a sound. You can find more detailed info about the schematics and the housing on my instructables: https://www.instructables.com/id/Pi-aser-a-Laser-Piano/

# Arduino
I used an Arduino UNO for my decibel meter and my RFID scanner. I used serial communcation between the raspberry pi and arduino to get the values on my RPI.

# RPI
I used a python script to get everything to work.
When you scan you will be able to see your times you played on the history graph on the site. You have to scan twice (first time to start second time to stop) You also be able to see your decibels live on the website if you scan your RFID badge.
