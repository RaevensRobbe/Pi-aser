# Pi-aser

I have made a laser piano for my final project of the first year of MCT

You have to place your hands under a laser and it will produce a note. You can find more detailed info about the schematics and the housing on my instructables: https://www.instructables.com/id/Pi-aser-a-Laser-Piano/

# Arduino

I used an Arduino UNO for my decibel meter and my RFID scanner. I used serial communcation between the raspberry pi and arduino to get the values on my RPI.

# RPI

I used a python script to get everything to work.

If you dont want a site to run and just the laser piano I recommend you to look at my app.py because there I have a fast scan over the ldr's if your hands are above it or not.
If you want to use the site i recommend to look at app_backup.py because in my app.py my site didnt work because of 2 threads and I couldn't find a solution in time.

Have a lot of fun with this project
!
